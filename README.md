# Flatconfig

Another very simple config class, based on flattened dictionaries this time. There are tons of config classes for Python.
I wanted one that made easy to merge settings coming from a configuration file and command line options, and I found none.

So I decided to write another simpe config class to do just that. I haven't succeeded yet. Don't use it yet.
